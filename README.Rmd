## Examples

### Google Business Profiles

This is a basic example which shows you how to extract the reviews form a Takedown zip file.


```{r example}
library(gtakeout)

# devtools::load_all()

takeout_zipfile <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data", "input"), glob = "*.zip") |>
  head(1)

output_path <- fs::dir_create(here::here("data", "output"))

gtakeout_reviews(takeout_zipfile, exdir = output_path)

```
